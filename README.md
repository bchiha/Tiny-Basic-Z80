## Tiny Basic for the Z80

This is the Tiny Basic port done by [Doug Gabbard](http://retrodepot.net/) for the Z80.  Tiny Basic was developed by Palo Alto, written by Li-Chen Wang in 1976. I have corrected some minor errors and now it will work properly.

The update was done so that I can add Tiny Basic to my 'BMON' monitor for the TEC-1F.  I have also added some extra functionality.  See my TEC-1F page for more information
